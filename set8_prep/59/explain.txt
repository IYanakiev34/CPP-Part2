In order to make use of std::async we
just need to issue each recursive call
to qsort to be done in a seperate thread.
At the end of the function we can just wait
for both sides to be sorted. Then in main
we create an array from 0 to 99 using iota.
The we shuffle it and print it so we validate
that the array is shuffled. After that we
proceed to sort it using the qsort and then
print it again to validate that it is indeed
sorted.
