First we create the matrices and fill them.
Next we init a 4x6 array of futures to store the results.
Then we loop over those dimensions, computing an inner 
product at each position. This computation is done in a 
packaged task containing a lambda which simply calls 
the inner product on the relevant positions. The lambda 
uses = as default capture because & causes the last one 
or a few more to be uninitialized. Finally we display the 
output once the futures finish. Example output:
    40 40 40 40 40 40
    40 40 40 40 40 40
    40 40 40 40 40 40
    40 40 40 40 40 40
Which is as expected since our first array is all twos and 
the second is all fours (2*4=8 and the inner dimension =5).
