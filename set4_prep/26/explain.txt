In order to instantiate a polymophic type through base class
we usually do:
        Base *bp = new Derived;
However now we want to create an array of specific size of objects
Derived and return a pointer to it. Thus we cannot do:
    Base *bp = new Derived[size];
This will produce segmentation fault. We need to do the following:
    Base **bpp = new Base*[size];
    for (std::size_t el = 0; el != size; ++el)
        bpp[el] = new Derived;
In this manner we create a pointer to size amount of pointers to the
Base class. Theneach pointer of the Base class points to a Derived object
in this manner we can then use the pointer to pointer as an array of derived
objects.
