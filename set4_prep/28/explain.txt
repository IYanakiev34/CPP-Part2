Implemented the overrided underflow method.
First check if buffer exists. If it does not, I determine
the maximal size of the buffer given the random range.
That way the buffer will suffice for any number generated 
and will not have to be adjusted when new numbers are produced. 
Then a value is produced until said value falls into the accepted
range. At that point the number is converted to a string and copied 
onto the buffer. Lastly, the next character pointed to by the buffer 
is returned.
