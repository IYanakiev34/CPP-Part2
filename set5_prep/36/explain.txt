We wrap the data inside the vector withing a shared pointer.
This allows us to still not handle new/delete, we only
need to modidy a few things in the calss namely the
constructor that takes a word, we need to then instantiate
the container with but wrap it inside a shared_ptr object. We
also need to slightly modify the [] operator.
