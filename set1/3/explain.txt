In order to copy file I have used the filesystem API's function copy_file. This function takes 2 arguments from and to.
However, this function does not solve the cirtical problem of the same timestamps. Thus by using the function last_write timestamp
and some basic arithmetic we are abel to modify the timestamp of the copied file to be exact match to the original file. The main function
calls the function copyFile(from,to) and tests our implementation.
