By refactoring the std::string * to a
std::vector<std::string> we benefit from
removing the destructor,copy/move operations.
This is due to the fact that that our class does
no longer need to manage memmory. The vector manages
the memory for us. Since we do not store pointer inside
of it. We have deliberatly added some basic constructors
that will make it a bit easier to use the class and
instantiate although it was not required.
