In order to solve the problem of sorting without using 
the built in sort function, we use the std::multiset<T>.
There the elements have natural sorting due to key comparison
function Compare, std::string has one. We chose std::multiset<T>
also because we might have 2 of the same words so we do not want
to forbid this scenario. Althouhg not mentioned in the exercise,
we decided to add functionality for command line parameter which
will specify the amount of words being scanned.
