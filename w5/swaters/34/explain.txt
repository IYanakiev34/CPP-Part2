This exercise is similar to the last one. This time though, you
need to track multiple occurrences. I was tempted to use a
multiset because it's just a set that allows duplicates. However,
I decided that iterating over duplicates would be more challenging
than using a map. The keys of a map are sorted just like in a set,
but each key has an associated value. Then as the value, I use an
integer to count the number of occurrences. If the value is not
initialized, it is first assigned its default value of 0 and then
incremented. Then using almost the same code as the last exercise,
I accept the input and print the results.
