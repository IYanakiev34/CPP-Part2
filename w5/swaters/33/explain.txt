The key to this exercise is using a set. Sets are sorted in C++,
so after inserting the input from cin into the set, you can
iterate through the set and print out the elements, and they will
be in sorted order.

I took a liberty and included "!" as an escape word, so that
you can enter a just "!" and the program will stop reading input.
It will also stop if there is nothing left to read.
