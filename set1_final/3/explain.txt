We had to develop a small function which would copy a file without using 
the streams in cpp. The copied file had to have the same timestamp as the original
this was done using the std::filesystem:;copy_file and last_write_time functions.The 
main function accepts 2 arguments passed on the command line. These are the from and to
destinations of the files.
