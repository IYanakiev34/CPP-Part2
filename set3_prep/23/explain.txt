Since WIP is a third party library it's API might change
in future releases. If use the composition described in the
exercises we are prone to be to tightly confided to the third-party
library calls. 

The same goes for when using comopsition we are directly using the
third-party library object in our class which might cse potentially error
in the future.

An alternative solution is to create wrapper class around the third-party
class. In that we we are more in control and now we are not so tightly confined
to the third-party class API. Even if the api changes it will only break our
wrapper class potentially. Now we only have to fix the wrapper and the code will
work as expected, but if we had not used wrapper we would have to manually fix
each place in the code where wed use the WIP object.
