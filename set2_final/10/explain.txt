Following the slides (specifically slide 34 and 35 of the exceptions lecture),
we have developed a function which handles the exceptions. Thus in the main function
no matter what type of exception is caught we have only one catch statement which calls a 
function to do the rest. This applies the 1:1 coordinate design. Since we did not have to implement
the class itself no implementations are created neither fore the class nor for the usage function. We
only accounted for what the exercise presumably wanted.
