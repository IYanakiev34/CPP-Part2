1. Output of the program is:
Thrown value: 1
main
The destructor is not called since we have a function try-block. Ones we encounter an exception and throw it
we never reach the end braces of the constructor thus the object is not 'properly constrcuted' and its destructor
woudl not be called.

2. If we modify the constructor to have a body try-catch block we could avoid the abovementioned issue.
We could throw and catch inside the constructor thus the object would have been properly created and it's
destructor will be called.

3. In the final program the destructor is called when the object goes out of scope in our case
when the try curly braces end since the object is declared inside the try block.
