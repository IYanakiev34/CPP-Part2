Following the slides (specifically slide 34 and 35 of the exceptions lecture),
we have developed a function which handles the exceptions. Thus in the main function
no matter what type of exception is caught we have only one catch statement which calls a 
function to do the rest. This applies the 1:1 coordinate design.
