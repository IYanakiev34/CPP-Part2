We create a simple program that allocates 10 objects from a class which can
only use maximum of 4 objects. In order to clean the memory afte the eception is thrown
we actually do not need to do much. If we only catch the exception the memory will 
automatically be freed since when new fails it automatically deletes any memory that
it has allocated.
