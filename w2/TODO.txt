Ivan:
I can handle ex 13 and probably 10 from the basic. From the advanced 14,15 seem fine.
I am pretty confident in my solutions for 1 and 3 although I think 3 might be unfinished due to
weird wording on his part.

Ex13- I think I have it correct I watched the videos but the question is very weird. Like what I have
done should be correct but I don't undertsand why he talks about how delete[] works when we don't even
use delete. Delete is automatically being used ones the exception is being called when new fails.

Ex15 tips: So i think the problem with exit(3) is that it calls every functions registered with atexit or onexit in reverse order
if one of these function contains something like longjmp then the behavior is undefined thus I believe this is the critical
flaw with the exit(). Now we only need to illustrate it
