If we create a Derived object using the base/copy/move constructor
the Base class base constructor is always called. Copy and move
constructors are not implicitly called when constructing the Base class.
In order for them to be called we need to explicitly call them in the 
initializer list of the Derived respective constructor.
    Example:
        Derived::Derived(Derived const &other)
            : Base(other)
        {}

If we wish to call the Base move constructor when using the Derived copy 
and call the Base copy when using the Derived move we need to do the following:

Case call Base move when using Derived Copy:
    Derived::Derived(Derived const &other)
        : Base(static_cast<Derived &&>(const_cast<Derived &>(other)))
        {}

Case call Base copy when using Derived Move:
    Derived::Derived(Derived tmp)
        : Base(tmp)
        {}
