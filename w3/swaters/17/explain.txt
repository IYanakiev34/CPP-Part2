Assume a class Derived is publicly inheriting from an existing class Base.
What members can be accessed by users of a Derived object?
    Any public members of Base and Derived.

What members can be accessed by Derived's designer?
    Any non-private members of Base and obviously all members of Derived.

What changes if Derived uses protected inheritance?
    Any inherited members of Base are now protected. They are no longer visible
    to users of Derived objects.

And what changes if Derived uses private inheritance?
    Any inherited members of Base are now private. They are no longer visible
    to users of Derived objects or inheritors of Derived (unless promoted with using).
