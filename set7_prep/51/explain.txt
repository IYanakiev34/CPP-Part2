First I check that the program receives its time argument.
Then I break the argument into an integer and a time unit.
Next I determine the current time with system clock now.
I convert now to time_t which can be passed to localtime and
gmtime, which can in turn be given to put_time. Next I add
the time argument to now by using a switch statement to convert
the time unit to the appropriate chrono unit. Then I display the
result in the same manner as above.
